    For improved funtionality on mobile devices, click the button below the zoom panel. When toggled on, this will disable drag and zoom (unless you use the zoom panel) and enable you to view specific community data by touching the community area. Using the maps below, we will compare hardship factors to the distrubution of crime by community area in an attempt to discover how certain factors may influence crime rates in Chicago.</p>

        <p class="lead">There are 6 factors that influence the hardship index in Chicago. These include percent unemployed and over 16, percent without a highschool diploma and over 25, percent living below poverty, percent under 18 and over 64, percent living in a crowded house and last, income per capita. The above map diplays crime rate by community area and excluding income per capita, 5 of the 6 social and economic factors that determine each communitie's hardship index. The crime rate data only includes crimes that resulted in an arrest. </p>

        <p class="lead">This second map visualizes each community area's hardship index along with the sixth factor, income per capita. The six factors that determine the score (employment, dependency, poverty, income, housing and education) are standardized on a scale from 1-100. A higher index indicates worse economic conditions.  </p>

            The crime rate was determined by dividing the amount of crimes which resulted in an arrest by the total population. Income per capita includes the income of every single human, including newborns. Some major findings include the following: Areas with highest crime typically have a low highschool graduation rate. Most areas that have a medium and above index have at least two hardship factors that likely have a major impact on the index score. In some cases, poverty and lack of education are high. In other cases, crowded housing and high poverty levels have major impacts on the index score. The one factor that was similar thoughout all the community areas, regardless of crime rate or hardship index was number of dependents (children and seniors).
